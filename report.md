## Introduction
- In this assignment, we were asked to create a simpler version of the famous streaming service, Netflix, using OOP.
- The assigment needed an interactive menu so that users could create accounts or log into them, search among available TV shows and movies on Netflix, watch them, or add them to their favorites. Users should also be able to search in the shows or movies they've already watched. Searches should be done in 3 ways; by title, by genre, or by the year the content was released.
- In this assignment we were asked to use inheritance, so we would get more familiar with it and how it works. It was also required that we get some more information on static and instance variables.

## Design and Implementation
- There are 5 different classes. The first one is for users that has a user's username, password, favorite shows and movies, their watch history, and also some methods for searching in their previously watched movies and TV shows, because that is unique for each individual. The second one is for TV shows that has a show's title, genre, year of release, number of seasons and episodes (bonus), rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and also an arraylist of the cast. The third class is for movies which extends from the TV show class and has similar attributes; except that the number of seasons and episodes both get set to one when they get initialized, and it also has an extra attribute which is the duration of the movie. The fourth class is the Netflix service class which keeps all the useful methods that later on get utilized in the program; e.g. the methods that search among all the content available on Netflix, the methods that print the attributes of content in a more neat way than just showing the arraylist (bonus), the methods that add or remove content from Netflix, the methods related to the login/signup process, etc. The Netflix service class also contains 3 essential arraylists; TV shows, movies, and users. Almost everything that gets done in this program, is somehow related to these 3 arraylists. And the last class is obviously the main class which I wrote the menu code in. I created an object of the Netflix services class and almost anything that I needed to do, had to be done using that object. I introduced a user called "manager" who manages the content on Netflix and can add or remove content from there. I also tried to make the menu as interactive as possible by making it look cleaner and also creating loops here and there to make it more user-friendly.
- This assignment was similar to the previous one in some ways. So I didn't really face a lot of challenges in those parts that they had in common. One thing that did  give me a hard time though, was when I was setting a few TV shows in my TV shows arraylist but kept running into this problem. Imagine you're adding 7 TV shows one by one. You add the first one and everything seems to be working perfectly fine. You add the second one, and then you end up with an arraylist of two TV shows that contains two of the same TV show, which was the last show I had added. And so by the time I had added the 7th show, I was left with an arraylist of 7 shows of the same kind. It took me a whole day to figure out the problem. I thought there was something wrong with the method that added the TV shows, or maybe the algorithm I was using for adding the shows, or even the arraylist of TV shows itself. After a day of trying to avoid the problem and continuing the code, my mentor helped me find out the problem. It was very simple, I had initialized the variables in my TV shows class as static, and that's probably the biggest thing that I learned from this assignment. Don't use static variables unless you need them.

## Testing and Evaluation
- I added some initial movies and TV shows for two reasons; one is that the user would have something to see and choose from, and two is that it made my testing process a lot easier and more efficient. I didn't have to add shows manually everytime I ran the code to check if different parts of the code worked. This helped me find out my errors a lot faster and I could debug them easier.

## Conclusion
- The main thing I learned from this assignment was working with inheritance and also truly understanding the difference between static and instance variables.
- There are a lot of things I would've done differently if I had more time. I would've made a more complex program that makes a lot more sense and I might've also used a GUI to make the result look more visually appealing. But the bug I mentioned earlier really slowed me down and put me behind schedule for a whole day. But I guess I had to learn this lesson the hard way. *Don't use static variables when you don't need them.*
